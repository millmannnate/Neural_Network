# Neural_Network
## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis intended to build a classifier that was able to predict if applicants would be successful.
## Results
* Data Preprocessing
  * What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? IS_SUCCESSFUL
  * What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? Every variable except IS_SUCCESSFUL
  * What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? EIN and NAME
* Compiling, training, and evaluating
  * How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
   First Layer: 80 neurons, relu activation
   Second Layer: 30 neurons, relu activation
   Third Layer: 1 neuron, sigmoid activation
  * Were you able to achieve the target model performance? No
  * What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? Change the neuron count and add extra layer.
